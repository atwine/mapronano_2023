    ">3 - __Linear Algebra:__ This is a necesarry skill if you are going to understand what you are doing. Most of the models are built in order to maximize or minimize certain linear and non linear functions. The math becomes intense the higher you get. This includes logic and formal methods.\n",
    "\n",
    ">4 - __Data Visualization:__ Being able to tell a compelling story with data is crucial to getting your point across and keeping your audience engaged. If your findings can’t be easily and quickly identified, then you’re going to have a difficult time getting through to others. \n",
    "\n",
